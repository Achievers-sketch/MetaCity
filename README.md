**MetaCity** is an immersive, decentralized city-builder game where players design, build, and manage their own virtual metropolis. Built with a modern web stack, it simulates blockchain concepts like NFTs for in-game assets and a DAO for governance, offering a unique blend of strategic gameplay and decentralized principles.

This project was bootstrapped with **Firebase Studio**.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic City Building**: Place various types of buildings, including residential, commercial, industrial, and parks.
- **Resource Management**: Balance key resources like Gold, Citizens, and Happiness to grow your city.
- **NFT-based Assets**: Every building and land parcel is simulated as an NFT, owned by the player.
- **DAO Governance**: Participate in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to vote on proposals that shape the game's future.
- **Simulated Marketplace**: Buy and sell building NFTs with other players in an in-game marketplace.
- **AI-Powered Gameplay**:
  - **Dynamic News**: An AI agent generates in-game news headlines based on real-world events, making the city feel alive.
  - **Generative Descriptions**: Get unique, AI-generated descriptions for your buildings.
  - **Smart Tutorials**: An AI-powered tutorial system provides contextual guidance based on your progress.
