## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft indigo (#7986CB) for a modern and calming feel, evoking the Web3 theme without being overwhelming.
- Background color: Dark slate gray (#37474F), a desaturated version of the primary, provides a sophisticated and less harsh dark mode experience.
- Accent color: Light amber (#FFB300), analogous to indigo, draws attention to key interactive elements, and balances well with dark mode styling.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern aesthetic, readable in both headlines and body text.
- Lucide-react for icons. Consistent and simple icons to represent buildings, resources, and actions.
- Use Tailwind CSS grid for a responsive layout with clear sections for the map, resource counters, and building menus. Minimum width of 1280px.
- Smooth transitions and hover effects using Tailwind CSS transitions for an engaging user experience.
